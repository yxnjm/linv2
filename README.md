# Xray Client Auto Installer and Runner

A simple and efficient Bash script to install, update, configure, and run the [Xray-core](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) client on Linux systems. The script automatically parses a VLESS URI to generate the JSON config file, sets up SOCKS5 and HTTP inbound proxies, and manages the Xray process lifecycle.
